## Current Status

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). SICC PICCS currently deploys a React, Apollo Boost, and Clarifai frontend, with a decoupled Hasura/Postgres database layer.

Our app was built for the [2018 freeCodeCamp JAMstack Hackathon](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/freecodecamp-is-hosting-a-free-hackathon-at-github-in-san-francisco-and-an-online-hackathon-too-2078088df278), where it placed in the Top 7! Presently, our biggest goal is to add multiplayer experiences which allow players to register usernames and play private or custom games with friends.
